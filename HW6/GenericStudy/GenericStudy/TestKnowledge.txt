1. Describe the problem generics address.
Generics address the problem of code reusability and type safety.

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<string> listOfStrings = new List<string>();


3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
has two generic type parameters: TKey and TValue.


4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they do not need to match; they can be different types depending on what is required by the implementation.

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
Using function Add()


6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
Remove(T item)
Remove(int index)

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
name with angle brackets enclosing the type parameter

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
No. Generic can have mutiple generic tpyes

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
Yes

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to
yes
